Insights and Recommendations: Provided data-backed insights about what Texas does well and recommended areas of improvement.
Key Features:

#### Alteryx Workflow: The Alteryx workflow is well-organized, documented, and easy to follow. It is fully repeatable and efficient.
Data Visualization: All visualizations support the conclusion/answer to the question. Visualizations are correctly constructed and appropriate for the question asked and the data used.
Insights: Insights, logical arguments, and key patterns are developed with a clear and strong point of view that supports the solution for the stated problem.
